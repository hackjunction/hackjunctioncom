                        <h2>What is JunctionX?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Junction started out in Finland, but over the years
                            our community has spread worldwide. We wanted to
                            share what we had learned about organizing
                            hackathons, as well as spread the hackathon movement
                            internationally.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since 2018, our teams around the world have created
                            their own hackathons through the JunctionX program:
                            the same Junction mentality, but all events with a
                            personal touch of the local teams.

                            hackathons, we are bound to create a world where all
                            ideas can become reality.
